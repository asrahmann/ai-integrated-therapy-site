# AI-Integrated Therapy Platform: Dr. Gulshan Psychology

> **⚠️ DEMO NOTICE:** This entire website is a **demonstration project**. It is not an active medical practice, and no services are actually being offered. The content, including the AI chatbot ("Gumbo"), is for showcase purposes only to demonstrate technical web development and AI integration capabilities.

A modern, high-performance, and context-aware professional website built for Dr. Gulshan Nandinee Salim, Psy.D. This project serves as a showcase for **AI-Augmented Development**, demonstrating how complex architectural and technical requirements can be orchestrated using modern AI tools.

## 🧠 The "Gumbo" AI Assistant
The standout feature of this platform is **Gumbo**, a custom-built, context-aware chatbot.
- **Context-Locked:** Gumbo is trained specifically on Dr. Gulshan’s practice, including her "Haunted House Therapy™" method, fees, and clinical philosophy.
- **Safety First:** Hardcoded safety guardrails prevent the AI from offering clinical advice or diagnosis, directing users toward official consultations instead.
- **Memory Management:** Features a "10-Turn Compaction" cycle where it summarizes long conversations to maintain context without exceeding token limits or losing focus.
- **Streaming UI:** Implements a character-by-character typing animation for a premium, human-like interaction feel.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture
- **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap 5. Chosen for extreme speed, SEO optimization, and long-term maintainability.
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express. Acts as a secure bridge between the user and OpenAI, protecting API secrets.
- **AI Engine:** OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo.
- **Design System:** A custom "Wellness/Spa" aesthetic utilizing a Sage Green and Warm White palette for a therapeutic user experience.

## 🤖 AI-Augmented Development Disclosure
In the spirit of transparency, **100% of the code in this repository was generated using AI agents (Gemini/GPT)**. 

My role in this project was that of the **Solutions Architect and Product Manager**:
1.  **Information Architecture:** I defined the sitemap, user flow, and content hierarchy based on the client's existing clinical needs.
2.  **Logic Design:** I architected the memory compaction logic for the chatbot and defined the safety guardrails.
3.  **Visual Direction:** I directed the UI overhaul, moving from a dark theme to a light "Be Well" aesthetic to better align with the therapeutic mission.
4.  **Integration:** I handled the orchestration of the frontend/backend bridge and ensured all technical components functioned as a cohesive platform.
